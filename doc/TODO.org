#+TODO: TODO DOING DONE WAIT CANCELED

* Xournal / OCR [0%]

** TODO Labeling documents
Class hierarchy and file organization

** TODO Training [0%]
 - [ ] from documents
 - [ ] training sets
 - [ ] Transformations & filtering
   
*** WAIT MNist, emnist [0%]
  - [ ] Training & output of:
    - [ ] inverted
    - [ ] angle
    - [ ] translation
    - [ ] scale?
    - [ ] blur
    - [ ] opacity over ???
  - [ ] Combining MNist and EMNist: label to output mapping
  - [ ] RGB coloring
  - [-] Cairo text rendered examples
    - [ ] standalone and with context in words
    - [X] Many fonts and styles and sizes
  - [ ] Random noise background
  - [ ] Random letter/number background
  - [ ] Delay yielding of composed CUDA vectors: memory is getting used up that can not be freed as Enumerable#cycle maintains references to the CUDA Vectors.
    
*** Bounding box, 2D arrays, and plaintext
  - [ ] Layers
    - [ ] Maxpool 2d
    - [ ] Deconvolve
    - [ ] Edge detector?
  - [ ] word search (with backgrounds)
  - [ ] word messes: search but with random angles and sizes

** TODO Scanning [%]
  - [ ] inputs
    - [ ] Xournals
    - [ ] images
    - [ ] PDF
  - [ ] Outputs
    - [ ] labeled bounding box
    - [ ] merged bounding boxes into words (word segmentation network?)
    - [ ] to 2d array of characters and details
    - [ ] plain text approximating layout

* Bugs [0%]

** TODO dot vs product

** TODO Convolution::Box2d

** TODO Conv2d could use CUDA on the backprop and update.

** Adam trainer only equalized all outputs

** Too few tests

* Enhancements

** by-layer: Box2d subnetworks from file, updatable or not.

** Human readable network output lables.

** Tool scripts
*** Tool to edit networks: add outputs, add inputs, add layers, delete, etc.
*** Tool to run STDIN input through a network.
*** Tool to load and preview a data set.

** CUDA powered image transform and filter stacks

** Ruby and CUDA vector interop: small vectors (<4) stay as Ruby, Ruby vectors promote to CUDA if the other operand is CUDA.

** Convolve all vector ops?

** Audio dataset
Wake words? Speaker/noise identification
Full speech to text
Text to speech
Song ID

** Training a range of layers instead of just the "output".

** Parallel batches / multiple Network; forward calls: variant of convolution w/ dx=dy=0.

** Parallelize convolutions: run whole networks w/o calling back to Ruby.

* Misc

** Documentation
